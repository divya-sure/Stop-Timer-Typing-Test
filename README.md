📜 How It Works

A random sentence is displayed for the user to type.
When the user starts typing, the timer starts automatically.
If a character is typed incorrectly, the input field border turns red.
Once the entire string is typed correctly, the border turns green, and the timer stops automatically.
The app then displays the total time taken and accuracy.

📱 Responsive Design

Uses CSS Media Queries to ensure a smooth user experience on different screen sizes.
Mobile-friendly UI with touch support.

⚠️ Troubleshooting

If the timer does not start, ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
If the text input is not registering correctly, check for console errors in the browser.
